I have seldom met a person who has not used a computer. But only few of them have genuinely understood how it works. With this text I intend to help more people to understand how a computer works. Computer is like a thick history book. It materializes thoughts and efforts from many people.

For one who loves computers, I would like to show that there is a world of art hidden behind the better and worse designed metallic boxes.

For the reader of popular computer science, I might explain what is behind the recent "hypes" (sometimes not) reported in the media: artificially intelligent computers, neural networks, big data, internet of things, deep learning, security and digitalization. I hope to answer some questions about the computer architectures, operating systems, programming languages and clouds, like why there are so many of them, why it is not easy to learn about them.

For those of you who already has spent a lot of time with computers and have developed considerable skills, I hope to offer an insight into other disciplines, which at the first sight might be unrelated.

I am lucky to be explaining a subject whose principles underlie Netflix, HBO, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. 

```golang
var s []byte
s = make([]byte, 5, 5)

func main() {
    startChat()
}
```

```a
movl    -4(%ebp), %eax
MOV UP, ACC

WPORT:
  MOV LEFT, DOWN
