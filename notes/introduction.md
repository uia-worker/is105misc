I have seldom met a person who has not used a computer. But only few of them have genuinely understood how it works. With this text I intend to help more people to understand how a computer works. Computer is like a thick history book. It materializes thoughts and efforts from many people.

For one who loves computers, I would like to show that there is a world of art hidden behind the better and worse designed metallic boxes.

For the reader of popular computer science, I might explain what is behind the recent "hypes" (sometimes not) reported in the media: artificially intelligent computers, neural networks, big data, internet of things, deep learning, security and digitalization. I hope to answer some questions about the computer architectures, operating systems, programming languages and clouds, like why there are so many of them, why it is not easy to learn about them.

For those of you who already has spent a lot of time with computers and have developed considerable skills, I hope to offer an insight into other disciplines, which at the first sight might be unrelated.

I am lucky to be explaining a subject whose principles underlie Netflix, HBO, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft.

This text is intended for everyone who uses computer.

You are probably reading these words using a computer screen. And each of us is probably reading these words on different computers. How is it possible to show those words to you on that particular screen?
Everything started with me having an idea of writing this text. I am a computer user and I am in a possession of several devices I could call computer, but in this case I am using a MacBook Pro computer. To write or to produce this text, I need to use some INPUT device. It could a microphone able to anlyze my voice and convert my speech to text. It could some sort of keyboard, depending on the language I am writing in or if I have any disabilities (blind people, for example, use Braille sign system). It could be a screen I touch at specific locations (usually guided by a visual picture of a keyboard), and produce the text sign by sign in that way. Hypotetically, this text could also be produced by a computer itself, but the capabilities of "artificial intelligence" are still (in 2017) very limited. 

DISTRACTION, RECONSIDER?
What does i mean? I am privileged not only using a computer, but also having an access to a network of computers which are connected by some communication channel. Someone has made this program called "web browser" and using that I can access other computers on the network. On some of those computers, there is a detailed information about my computer.
